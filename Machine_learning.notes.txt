                            Steps for Machine learning project
1. Import the Data (Data often comes in a CSV file. if not export the data to one for the project)
2. Clean the Data (includes: Removing duplicated data, Removing irrelevant data, Remove or modify incomplete data, convert text based data to numerical values etc)
3. Split data into 2 sets (Training and Test sets)
4. Create a model (involves selecting an appropriate algorithm for data analysis. these algorithms dont necessarily need to be self-made as there are libraries that contain these)
5. Train the model (Feed it training data)
6. Ask it to make predictions
7. Evaluate and improve (you caan change the algorithm used to test how much improvement there would be or fine-tune the model parameters)


                Popular Python Libraries used in Machine learning projects
NUMPY (provides a multidimensional array)
PANDAS (a data analysis library that provides data frame(a 2d data structure similar to an excel spreadsheet)) 
MATPLOTLIB (a 2d plotting library for creating graphs on plots)
SCIKIT-LEARN (provides common algorithmslike decision trees, neural networks etc)


when working on Machine learning we use "JUPYTER" to write our code. we can still use vscode to write it but its not ideal
cuz we frequently need to inspect the data and that is hard in environments like vscode
